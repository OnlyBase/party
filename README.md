Welcome to the **BASED Block Party** GitHub repository, a community hub for sharing design assets, memes, flyers, and tracking all the amazing projects participating in this vibrant event!

## What is Onchain Summer?

Onchain Summer is a celebration of all things onchain, where the community comes together to showcase, share, and celebrate the creativity and innovation happening in the blockchain space. Just like a concert T-shirt lists all the acts playing, this repo will keep track of the projects participating in Onchain Summer **BASED Block Party**.
